# Berkeley iOS Decal Coursework

[Stanford honor code](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164/handouts/honor-code.pdf) does not allow posting solution code on public website. I took the wonderful [CS193P iOS Application Development course](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316) with Paul Hegarty at Stanford University but unfortunately cannot showcase my concentration game, set game, image gallery etc. projects here. So I decided to work through the [iOS projects at Berkeley](http://iosdecal.com/) and have fun coding!
